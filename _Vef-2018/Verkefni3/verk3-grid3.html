        <div class="main"><h3>About Shrek</h3>Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated, comedy film loosely based on the 1990 fairytale picture book of the same name by William Steig.
        Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow
        as the voices of the lead characters. The film parodies other films adapted from fairy tale storylines,
        primarily aimed at animated Disney films. In the story, Shrek (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished 
        by a corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control
        of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona (Diaz), whom he intends to marry. With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest
        but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever</div>
        <div class="aside2"><h3>Review from a viewer</h3>Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote "Shrek is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the Academy 
        when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year.<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Another Review from a viewer</h3>Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it four stars out of a possible four and describing it as 
        "jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart.
